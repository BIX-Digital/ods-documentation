# The ODS Antora Playbook Repository

## Building documentation locally

Because we use plantuml for creating of diagrams, it is important, that a plantuml server is running.
Currently the system is configured to use a local plantuml server when building locally.

You can start a server using a docker container

    docker run -d -p 9080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty

Then you are able to generate the documentation

   antora site-workspace.yml

or if you want to include all versions

   antora site-workspace-full.yml

## Building on travis

Whenever this repository is pushed to github, it triggers a travis build, that regenerates the antora documentation based on the `site.yml` playbook.
