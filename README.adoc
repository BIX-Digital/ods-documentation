# The ODS Antora Playbook Repository

## Building documentation locally

### Prerequisites

#### OpenDevStack Repositories
The following OpenDevStack Repositories have to be cloned and stored beside the _ods-documentation_ repository:

- opendevstack.github.io
- ods-core
- ods-jenkins-shared-library
- ods-provisioning-app
- ods-project-quickstarters
- ods-docs-ui

Take care that _../ods-docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip_ has been build before. If you are not already
familar with _ods-docs-ui_ project, a closer look at the documentation at
https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-docs-ui/blob/ods-docs-ui/README.adoc
and the following hint may help to create the requiered zip-file:

    cd ../ods-docs-ui
    # compile
    npm install
    # create file ui-bundle.zip
    gulp bundle


#### PlantUML-Server
Because we use PlantUML for creating of diagrams, it is important, that a plantuml server is running.
Currently the system is configured to use a local plantuml server when building locally.
Plantuml server can be downloaded from https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server. It runs as
docker container or can be started with a jetty server out of the box. See the documentation at
github and the following explanations for details.


*Start as Docker container*:

You can start a server using a docker container

    docker run -d -p 9080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty

*Start as jetty server via maven*:

    mvn mvn jetty:run -Djetty.port=9080 -Djetty.contextpath=/

*Classic way (not recommend)*:

Since PlantUML is a simple web application, you can even go the classic way and build a war - archive
and deploy it to your java application server.


### Run the buil locally
Then you are able to generate the documentation

   antora site-workspace.yml

or if you want to include all versions

   antora site-workspace-full.yml

## Building on travis

Whenever this repository is pushed to github, it triggers a travis build, that regenerates the antora documentation based on the `site.yml` playbook.
